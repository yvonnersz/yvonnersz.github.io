Hello, World! 

My name is Yvonne and I graduated at SJSU with a BS in Chemistry. After graduating, I worked as a chemist at a semiconductor company for 2.5 years when a family emergency came up. After resigning, I moved to Texas for a few months to help out with my family's business. During this period, I contemplated whether or not I still wanted to stay in the chemistry field. After much deliberation, I decided to take the plunge and enroll to a coding bootcamp.

I have very little experience in coding. The only experience I have in coding is dabbling in HTML and CSS. Back when Xanga and Myspace days were popular, I had spent most of my after-school hours creating banners and layouts. It was a pleasurable experience. When Facebook became popular ; however, page customization was not an option anymore so that's when my "coding" journey came to a pause. 

In college, I was pushed into the chemistry major even though it never really 'clicked' with me. It was only after graduating and working in the field that I came to realize that chemistry didn't give me that sense of fulfillment in life. I enjoy building things, but my current degree in Chemistry didn't allow for that. 

However, after enrolling in this course, I have found myself waking up eager to code. I am excited to start my coding journey once again after a long hiatus. I believe that automation is the future and I would love to play a small role in that.
