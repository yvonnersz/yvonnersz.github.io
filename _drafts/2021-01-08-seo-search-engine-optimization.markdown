## SEO

Search Engine Optimization. Attempting to make your website more visible in search engines such as Google, for example by spreading links to it all over the web. Tweaks and actions taken against a website and/or search engines in order to make it appear on the highest possible rank on the result list of a related search query. Search engine optimization (SEO) improves the ability of your business to be found by search engines, such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing.

When you search for something on YouTube or Amazon, there are rules to see what videos or items are shown first. It’s up to the vlogger or the seller to find the best way to write their title and description (and other things) to play by the rules and get their video or item into the goal, which is to be first, second or third in the list.

Tweaking your content (and other things) to best play by the rules is called SEO.

The fun thing is that there are many rules, and we don’t know what they all are exactly, and they change from time to time.

SEO is basically the exploitation of a search engine (read: Google) algorithm. You're designing the site in a way that gets the most attention from Google's crawlers and indexer, putting it (hopefully) somewhere on result-page 1 or 2 for certain search terms.

Note that search engine algorithms change over time, so SEO methods need to be updated from time to time. Also search engine algorithms are usually secret, so it's lots of trial and error.
