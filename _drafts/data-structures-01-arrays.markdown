The most basic of all data structures, an array stores data in memory for later use. An array is the simplest and most widely used data structure. Whenever youâ€™d like to use the array, all you need are the desired indices, and you can access any of the data within.

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

The structure of an array consists of:
- index
- elements

## Basic Operations on Arrays
- Get -- returns the element at given index
- Insert -- inserts an element at given index
- Delete -- deletes an element at given index
- Size -- gets the total number of elements in an array

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Arrays

### Pros
- Store similar data types.
- Iterations in arrays runs faster compared to other data structures.
- Offers fast O(1) search if index is known.

### Cons

- Allocating more memory than you need can waste memory space.
- The cost of inserting and deleting is high because the elements of an array are stored in contiguous memory locations.
