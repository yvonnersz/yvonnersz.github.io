So I've been reaching out to people who have worked in the software industry asking them for things that I could read up on to improve my skills.

One person told me about the atomic design principle. 

For those who don't know, I have a background in Chemistry and have made the switch to software. 

Imagine how excited I was when I read that the atomic design principle was inspired by chemistry!

Atomic Design is a methodology inspired by chemistry. Just as all matter is made out of atoms that combine to form molecules, which in turn make up more complex organisms, Atomic Design involves breaking a website down into its basic components and then working up from there to create a site.

Atomic Design is a methodology created by Brad Frost seeking to provide direction on building interface design systems more deliberately and with explicit order and hierarchy.

The name Atomic Design comes from the idea of separating the components in atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages, like in the image above.

## Atoms

Atoms are the smallest possible components, such as buttons, titles, inputs or event color pallets, animations, and fonts.

## Molecules

Molecules can have their own properties and create functionalities by using atoms, which donâ€™t have any function or action by themselves.

## Organisms

Organisms are the combination of molecules that work together or even with atoms that compose more elaborate interfaces. At this level, the components begin to have the final shape, but they are still ensured to be independent, portable, and reusable enough to be reusable in any content.
