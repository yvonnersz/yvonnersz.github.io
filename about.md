Upon graduating from San Jose State University with a BS in Chemistry, I worked as a chemical operator manufacturing the world's highest-performance quantum dots. I gained a whole new set of practical skills and knowledge at this company but after an unforeseen circumstance, I was forced to reevaluate my career path.

Back when Xanga existed, I didn't know it at the time but I was actually already manipulating basic HTML and CSS. I would spend hours of my own free time reading tutorials, manipulating code, and testing that code to see if it worked correctly. So when I was reevaluating my career path, I remembered this particular period in my life that I enjoyed.

This moment was when I decided to take the plunge into software engineering. I was accepted into a bootcamp and was able to leave with a knowledge in: Ruby, Sinatra, Rails, SQL, JavaScript, React, and Redux. I hope that with my previous experience in Chemistry, I can transfer these skills into a career where I can build and develop things from the ground-up.
